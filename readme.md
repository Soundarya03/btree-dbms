<b>DSC Hack 2020 : Basic DBMS implementation using B-trees<b>
<br>
<p>
    B Tree is a specialized m-way tree that can be widely used for disk access. A B-Tree of order m can have at most m-1 keys and m children. One of the main reason of using B tree is its capability to store large number of keys in a single node and large key values by keeping the height of the tree relatively small.<br>
    B-trees are M-way search trees with guidelines:<br>
    If m is the order of the B-tree,<br>
    1. Every node in a B-Tree contains at most m children.<br>
    2. Every node in a B-Tree except the root node and the leaf node contain at least m/2 children.<br>
    3. The root nodes must have at least 2 nodes.<br>
    4. All leaf nodes must be at the same level.<br>
